# BingoUI

A Hollow Knight: Silksong mod to show counts of various in-game statistics
on the screen. This is primarily intended as an tool for Bingo races.

Settings can be configured in the BepInEx config file,
by using [ConfigManager](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/jakobhellermann/BepInExConfigurationManager/),
or [ModMenu](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/silksong_modding/ModMenu/).

## Notes

For the consumable collectible trackers (e.g. rosary necklaces), the text appears as X(Y), where
X is the number currently in the inventory and Y is the total number ever picked up. Y excludes
from reusable sources such as rosary machines and shops, but includes from shiny items.

## Planned counters

* Craftmetal
* Relics
* Silkeaters
