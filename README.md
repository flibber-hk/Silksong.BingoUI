# BingoUI

A Hollow Knight: Silksong mod to show counts of various in-game statistics
on the screen. This is primarily intended as an tool for Bingo races.

## Important note

Currently the counters have been disabled, and only the spent geo tracker is functional.
The counters will be added as and when I get icons for them.

## Notes

For the consumable collectible trackers (e.g. rosary necklaces), the text appears as X(Y), where
X is the number currently in the inventory and Y is the total number ever picked up. Y excludes
from reusable sources such as rosary machines and shops.

## WIP

This mod is currently a work in progress. Icons can and should be created from the
template in the assets folder.

Anything that requires save data does not behave properly at the moment. It will
be reset when you close the game, but will *not* be reset when entering a different
save file.

Things like config options, more counters (obviously), and ItemChanger integration,
are planned.

## Requested counters

* Craftmetal, relics

Note - I think there aren't enough cogheart pieces to merit a separate counter for them.
