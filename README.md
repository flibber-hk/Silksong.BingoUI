# BingoUI

A Hollow Knight: Silksong mod to show counts of various in-game statistics
on the screen. This is primarily intended as an tool for Bingo races.

## Installation

The latest version of the mod can be downloaded from the actions tab (requires
a github account). You will also need dependencies downloaded from Thunderstore,
the list of dependencies is available in this repo at thunderstore/thunderstore.toml
(version numbers don't matter).

When this mod is ready for release, I'll remove this section (with the expectation
that people install it with a Thunderstore-aware mod installer that can automatically
handle dependencies).

## WIP

This mod is currently a work in progress. Icons can and should be created from the
template in the assets folder.

Things like config options, more counters (obviously), and ItemChanger integration,
are planned.

## Requested counters

* Tools (one for each colour and one for total)
* Rosary strings picked up (shiny)
* Rosary necklaces picked up (shiny)
* Beast shards picked up (shiny)
* Craftmetal, relics, lockets, cogheart pieces
* Wishes by type, wishes overall (I guess type taken from the wiki page?)
* Spent rosary tracker (I tried to do this one first but it turns out to be harder than I was expecting)
